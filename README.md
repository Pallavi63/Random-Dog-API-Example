# Random-Dog-API-Example
This project demonstrates three different ways of making HTTP requests in Node.js using the Dog CEO API which provides random dog images.
It shows how to fetch data using:
1.Callbacks
2.Promises
3.Async/Await

The results are displayed on a simple Express server running on http://localhost:3000.

Features:
Uses the Dog CEO Public API to fetch random dog images.
Demonstrates three coding styles for handling asynchronous operations:
 1.Callback-based
 2.Promise-based
 3.Async/Await-based
Displays the results visually in the browser (dog images).

Installation & Setup:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/dog-api-example.git 
cd dog-api-example

Install dependencies:npm install

Start the server: node app.js

Usage:
Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000

You will see:
One random dog image fetched using callbacks
One random dog image fetched using promises
One random dog image fetched using async/await
